As such, this PDC place will focus on non-conventional ways of designing together, especially in relation to technology. Practitioners and communities come together and showcase what PD methods they have employed to design technology that supports social innovation.\n\n\nParticipatory Design and Digital Commons: bridging communities and creating synergies: A small but active community of digital commoners is active all around Greece and networking is crucial for its development. At the same time it is important to bring this community in contact with the innovation introduced in PDC in order to inspire the adoption of new methods and practices. We will explore what PD has to offer for digital commons initiatives to more closely and effectively work together, and how we can create a bridge between PD practitioners and digital commons initiatives.\n\n\n<a class=\"button is-primary\" download=\"paper.pdf\" href=\"https://pdc-2022.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/notion/-VyB4ig_AKd5G1yaS3flvFcGTmaxpOMB9-rDQx-bQqs.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download PDF →</a>\n\n\n"},{"id":"7f798b28-d378-4c60-a398-cce639358097","title":"Australia","sessions":["9b8d3711-8946-4d4f-908f-13a39d8e3b69","08dc718d-d453-460e-9f3d-16b619e86964","f4e3ad07-a073-4f58-bce0-fc70bddbc49a","c7aaafea-070e-45a0-aeb4-096a7368c409","d1b6af98-782d-48e6-afe4-d10204aa545e"],"content":"<a class=\"button is-primary\" download=\"paper.pdf\" href=\"https://pdc-2022.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/notion/NcxS9uViG5qwD_wnvv6TExGehCw5dpZ4BdKUwummCAQ.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download PDF →</a>"},{"id":"3f44005c-fbdd-477a-9fce-2dc91e6d2916","title":"Brasil","sessions":["0ae713e7-39e4-45b5-b0ca-f9047a76ca3a","454e04d1-95b0-4feb-9cad-64a4fef6eceb","56e22df0-2bcd-4eb3-8b89-6647fefbdf56","ccee0ee2-72c4-4135-bdbf-f23f0e7a4acd"],"content":"A Constellation of Spaces Ruffle of Feather\n\n\n<a class=\"button is-primary\" download=\"paper.pdf\" href=\"https://pdc-2022.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/notion/91bHwA9CkutNckjqahMiqlWdD8l-ha1MSKC7xEzr7bM.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download PDF →</a>"},{"id":"105a0cb2-9fd4-4422-b53c-e0d438b7143a","title":"East Africa","sessions":["4abf617f-9c40-41a5-9c5f-dc166d1c50dc","821e408c-e437-49c2-b52b-6292ec08e418"],"content":"Participatory Design, an East African Take\n\n\nNairobi is noted as a centre of ICT activity on the continent due to the number of tech universities, start-ups, venture capital funds and tech organisations.

Yet there should be awareness and understanding from the different sectors in Malaysia and SouthEast Asia, not only academia and industry, but also from the government and even the general public. We wanted to create that understanding, especially amongst non-traditional “connoisseurs” of PD such as the government, will help to develop products and services which are more effective, efficient, and meet the needs of target groups. This engagement also helps in creating opportunities to involve communities who may be underserved, such as rural communities.\n\nLooking at the previous proceedings of PDC, we can only find a very few contributions from Malaysia. Therefore by hosting, PDC Place in Malaysia we aim at growing new alliances with research communities and practitioners that allow for a structured exchange to inform change initiatives – local and around the world.\n\n\n<a class=\"button is-primary\" download=\"paper.pdf\" href=\"https://pdc-2022.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/notion/T3up6_djpFQBn-Aohr24Dx4AdjrjQvw27JwyRVpH6AM.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download PDF →</a>"},{"id":"442718ad-6aba-4a2b-8d6b-66c9e551d377","title":"Mexico","sessions":["a75af641-8b66-40e7-bdf9-105ad25d2b43","1d6edf2c-47d2-4fd5-82e1-18ebfe419aae","c163a3a6-2942-41c6-a5ea-43b2e59420de","66dec974-019a-41d5-82fb-1dccae111ba9","0567f0ed-f087-4d5a-b0c2-d26852687ff2"],"content":"Tracing Cacao in America\n\n\nMexico does not really have an old Participatory Design tradition and we see in PDC an opportunity to find out new ways to solve old problems. In the last few decades, quite a lot of national and international (public and private) proposals came out in different estates and towns of Mexico.\n\n\nOur motivation is to find our own “style of knowing and doing” (Otto and Smith, 2013:10), to reflect about participation and design in the South Global and to reflect on South-North Global, specifically, in the context of Mexico and our relationship with the continental north (USA-Canada). We want to think on the line between local and global; individual and collective; innovation and tradition.\n\n\nWe also want to approach these relationships from a rhizomatic perspective that understands different categories, disciplines and actors as an acentric constellation.

We see it as a great opportunity to expand the roles of public libraries even further, engaging citizens in co-design processes, improving existing public e-services and co-designing new services. That shift requires new roles taken by librarians, but also new processes, as well as new methods of development of e-services in the public sector. In PDC Place Nordic we explore this new role of libraries in participatory future making, engaging librarians, academics, practitioners, and different local communities.
