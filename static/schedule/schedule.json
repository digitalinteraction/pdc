I investigated older people’s perspectives, exploring how they might reimagine monitoring and tracking technologies in their life and future, by involving them in co-design and qualitative research. Monitoring technology solutions for older people’s independent living tends to treat them as passive recipients of technology to be observed by others. Together with my supervisors, we presented a design approach that shifts the emphasis from perceived needs to bring to light the lived values, agency and aspirations of older people.\n\n\nCurrently, I am investigating the design of new systems in which humans and machines interactively learn and explore together to have a more reciprocal and synergistic relationship. I am working with machine learning and Artificial Intelligence experts as well as domain experts who analyse, interpret and make decisions with data.

Embarking from the idea that new approaches to the design of sustainable everyday practices are needed to break the current deadlock, we suggest a new approach to the design of transitions of everyday life, which draws on participatory and co-design methods and has people’s everyday practices at the centre of design processes. The workshop will explore the opportunities that this approach can offer to current transitions, such as in the sectors of energy, building renovation, food and mobility.

We return to our original overarching Conference themes including the challenges of responding through democratic and socially just practices that foreground a diversity of agents to enact socio-political change.\n\n\nWe ask our panellists:\n\n\n* What are key areas of intervention and leveraging that participatory design is best suited to make impact? Conversely, what is PD less adequate in being able to do towards structural change?\n\n* What alliances and transdisciplinarity can we recognise, and also identify further in PD?"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":["7b6f03ed-b5f6-4e52-9b98-dcaf279f5cd0","1154ec83-dc09-4a5d-bb38-683bed8dd204","9c1d9639-294e-4f9b-a4ea-b8e2cfeaa5d3","ea782041-9420-4cdc-9510-06794a3843b9","da9e8397-7d91-433c-8ce0-b829d1d00a80","8d171b8b-ed21-400c-a1a8-1dcb3c4be972","b62ce802-698f-4f01-bc52-00a43b451f77"],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":true,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":false,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"84645d67-5409-4c87-94da-c8499e1b7f9e","type":"8d54cbe3-b7ae-467e-90dd-7dda601e2fc1","slot":"1661011200000__1661018400000","track":"76eed8bf-9103-4c92-9a9e-fcd0007be2d5","themes":[],"title":{"en":"Relationality, commoning, and designing (Session 1)"},"content":{"en":"** **THIS WORKSHOP IS ONLY OPEN TO PARTICIPANTS WHO HAVE SUBMITTED TO ORGANISERS ****\n\n\n[https://commoninganddesigning.wordpress.com/.](https://commoninganddesigning.wordpress.com/)\n\n\n\n\n\n**_Giacomo Poderi_** [gipo@itu.dk](mailto:gipo@itu.dk) \nIT University of Copenhagen, DK\n\n\n**_Sanna-Maria Marttila_**\nIT University of Copenhagen, DK\n\n\n**_Joanna Saad-Sulonen_**\nIT University of Copenhagen, DK\n\n\n**_Frederick M.C. van Amstel_**\nUTFPR, BR\n\n\n**_Maurizio Teli_**\nAalborg University, DK\n\n\n**_Linda Tonolli_**\nUniversità di Trento, IT\n\n\n**_Vincenzo D’Andrea_**\nUniversità di Trento, IT\n\n\n**_Andrea Botero_**\nAalto University FI/ Universidad de los Andes COL\n\n\n\n\n\nThis workshop explores and reflects upon both how relational ontologies can support design processes that target commons and commoning as outcomes, and how commons and commoning can work as speculative lenses for the understanding of relationality in Participatory Design.

We invite the PD community to reflect on the multiple ways learning can strengthen and expand how we frame and drive participatory design to reflect on how we can expand learning in PD to gain an understanding for the complex system we are all part of, for the interdependence of social, ecological and economic systems. Through this workshop, we will invite participants to address questions such as: What theories and concepts can be used to understand learning in PD? What kind of approaches are used to foster learning in PD? How is learning evaluated in PD? The workshop will bring together members of the PD community interested in these questions, and serve as the basis for developing ongoing and new collaborations around the topic of learning in PD.\n\n\nThis workshop runs over two half days with some activity taking place at the [Nordic PDCPlace](/085ef3a7eb14469189e9f182a6602958) on 26th September 12:00 pm to 3:00 pm UTC.

In this workshop, we will explore how we can better design not only for but with care in older adulthood, applying the PDC 2022 ’Senti-Pensar’ (thinking-feeling) lens, to ask ‘how can we enact and represent design practice that is difficult to describe but is heartfelt and passionate?’ We aim to challenge current narratives of care in HCI, embracing the diversity of experiences of older adults, and facilitating discussion around a future of care that values interdependency, relationality, and thinking-feeling in design. By considering multiple perspectives on care in older adulthood, we will speculate on the role of technologies within future ecosystems of care, where care is the concerted and organising principle.\n\n\n\n"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":["31455afd-1aa2-4624-897a-6047597ef3d8","5cd33c04-ac15-41e3-ac73-28e30af6590f","5a81fd52-ffb6-42ba-8df0-fa4f4d844f93","7b6f03ed-b5f6-4e52-9b98-dcaf279f5cd0","bfe5a8e1-7c31-457b-89df-594aa5d65bd6","078f0119-1383-475a-adbc-605002e9fe7a","75585250-b5f3-4d5d-bcb5-8ddd2f64f31a"],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":false,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":false,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"a90a93a1-4071-45e6-b82c-4ed478c1d2f5","type":"4031cd9e-b72e-440d-8da3-56fc4ed3bbec","slot":"1661155200000__1661169600000","track":"76eed8bf-9103-4c92-9a9e-fcd0007be2d5","themes":[],"title":{"en":"Doctoral Colloquium - Session 2"},"content":{"en":"****** THE DOCTORAL COLLOQUIUM IS ONLY OPEN TO PARTICIPANTS WHO HAVE SUBMITTED TO AND HAD THEIR WORK ACCEPTED BY THE ORGANISERS ******\n\n\nThe 2022 Doctoral Colloquium is a community-building component of the conference that aims to create opportunities for PhD candidates at a range of stages in their research work to be together to share and make new knowledge, discuss the processes and challenges of PhD work and Participatory Design research and practice, and to further ground their participation in, and expansion of, PD worlds. In keeping with many of the themes that run through PDC2022, as well as emergent and contemporary themes in PD research and practice, the Doctoral Colloquium participants in 2022 are wrestling with and pushing forward critical conversations about and engagements with positionality, ethics, ideas of empathy and abilities of participatory practices in a range of settings, across the world. The Doctoral Colloquium participants are located in different areas of the world (Europe, Australia, USA, Russia, South Korea), reflecting a cultural diversity that is manifested in their approach to and engagement with PD. The PDC 2022 Doctoral Colloquium will take the form of a series of distributed online sessions that provide students with a safe and open space to discuss what matters to them concerning their studies, and collaboratively seek ways to address them. Participants share their work and experiences, receive feedback, support, and suggestions from experienced PD researchers and peers.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Research-through-Design for Developing a Codesign Facilitator’s Guide Toolkit\n\n\n**_Melis Örnekoğlu Selçuk_**\n\n\n## Collaborative methodologies that emerge from\nwithin: by who, for whom, what for, to whose benefit and at whose\ncosts?\n\n\n**_Elvia Vasconcelos_**\n\n\n## The efficacy of design methods for public and\nsocial sector innovation in Western Australia\n\n\n**_Shari Freeman_**\n\n\n## Public libraries as spaces for innovation of public\ndigital services through Participatory Design processes\n\n\n**_Camilla Vesterberg Christensen_**\n\n\n## Personhood: defined, collected, and integrated\n\n\n**_Amber De Coen_**\n\n\n## Developing Critical Futures Literacies with and through Design\n\n\n**_Laura Barendregt_**\n\n\n## Exploring augmented reality for diverse voices in\ntechnology\n\n\n**_Nelli Holopainen_**\n\n\n## Trust Building in Collective Practices\n\n\n**_Caoimhe Beaulé_**\n\n\n## Idiotic agents within home: Expanding interactions between humans and Intelligent Personal Assistants beyond automated functionality\n\n\n**_Maria Tsilogianni_**\n\n\n## Pluriversal Technologies for Native Grains\n\n\n**_Angus Mitchell_**\n\n\n## Enabling co-design from design to architecture:\nRethinking the role of tools, techniques, strategies and methods\n(TTSM)\n\n\n**_Çiğdem Yönder_**\n\n\n## Published paper\n\n\n<a class=\"button is-primary\" download=\"paper.pdf\" href=\"https://pdc-2022.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/notion/y4ZiXYehwHYm4_duFuLETHOww1fdP5NjEIsBzFWFLbc.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download PDF →</a>\n\n\n\n\n****** THE DOCTORAL COLLOQUIUM IS ONLY OPEN TO PARTICIPANTS WHO HAVE SUBMITTED TO AND HAD THEIR WORK ACCEPTED BY THE ORGANISERS ******\n"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":["fc2c4cab-073a-469e-b538-9a02af69717b","987b49c4-9709-4d20-8ba9-324af9c72799","f8c1f4f1-a79c-468d-941c-a44339afa336","173afcbf-0d05-4d7d-a7e2-190b37d632fb","e3c79811-0b25-4fee-b167-1ae88d51aef2"],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":false,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":false,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"f9b16569-05c7-4225-8abe-863bb46b29ba","type":"8d54cbe3-b7ae-467e-90dd-7dda601e2fc1","slot":"1661184000000__1661191200000","track":"76eed8bf-9103-4c92-9a9e-fcd0007be2d5","themes":[],"title":{"en":"Relationality, commoning, and designing (Session 2)"},"content":{"en":"** **THIS WORKSHOP IS ONLY OPEN TO PARTICIPANTS WHO HAVE SUBMITTED TO ORGANISERS****\n\n\n[https://commoninganddesigning.wordpress.com/.](https://commoninganddesigning.wordpress.com/)\n\n\n\n\n\n**_Giacomo Poderi_** [gipo@itu.dk](mailto:gipo@itu.dk)\nIT University of Copenhagen, DK\n\n\n**_Sanna-Maria Marttila_**\nIT University of Copenhagen, DK\n\n\n**_Joanna Saad-Sulonen_**\nIT University of Copenhagen, DK\n\n\n**_Frederick M.C. van Amstel_**\nUTFPR, BR\n\n\n**_Maurizio Teli_**\nAalborg University, DK\n\n\n**_Linda Tonolli_**\nUniversità di Trento, IT\n\n\n**_Vincenzo D’Andrea_**\nUniversità di Trento, IT\n\n\n**_Andrea Botero_**\nAalto University FI/ Universidad de los Andes COL\n\n\n\n\n\nThis workshop explores and reflects upon both how relational ontologies can support design processes that target commons and commoning as outcomes, and how commons and commoning can work as speculative lenses for the understanding of relationality in Participatory Design.

This workshop is a supportive space for conference participants engaged with the commons to explore how they conceptualize and communicate the commons internally and externally. The workshop will focus on critiquing and adapting the Commons Model Canvas, an adaptation of the Business Model Canvas created by the workshop organizers to validate their own commoning practices. Participants are invited to complete a Commons Model Canvas for their project, share this work with the group for discussion, and to participate in adapting the Commons Model Canvas for future use. Based on our own research through design, participants can expect: to expand their knowledge about the commons and pluriversal design, to gain insightful peer feedback on their commoning projects, and to forge a potential peer network for future collaboration.\n"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":["3ac37343-ad33-42e7-a041-608301aaf38c"],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":false,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":false,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"2f178f96-427d-4928-8577-3665a12ce947","type":"8d54cbe3-b7ae-467e-90dd-7dda601e2fc1","slot":"1661846400000__1661857200000","track":"208826eb-ec6e-4dc0-9c4a-c480968bbe2c","themes":[],"title":{"en":"Phenomena: Co-Designing Planetary Care Through Joy (Session 1)"},"content":{"en":"**Phenomena: Co-Designing Planetary Care Through Joy**\n\n\nhttps://www.phenomena.cloud/workshops\n\n\n**_Ruth Isabel D.

Within this framework, fear becomes the catalyst for change. But how can we be certain that our solutions will lead to positive outcomes? PHENOMENA is a world-building tool and experience that approaches caring for our planet through the radical act of joy. This workshop fosters open collaboration among teams through participatory design (PD) approaches and situates play as central to the design process. It is intended to offer an alternative design methodology, establish meaningful connections with our planet, and democratize the pursuit of solving world problems. Workshop sessions are open to anyone interested in this topic, preferably those from interdisciplinary and multicultural backgrounds. Participants should be open to playing games and engaging in physical theatre within a group setting.\n\n\n[Please note this session is linked to a further session running 3-6pm BST on the same day.](https://schedule.pdc2022.org/session/3df50786-dba9-4382-a670-99896489229b)    \n\n\n\n"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":["d2ac5974-d0ef-4e00-a349-644271fc19a8"],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":false,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":false,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"7df9831e-6d59-402d-ae4b-39e9bbba3d96","type":"8d54cbe3-b7ae-467e-90dd-7dda601e2fc1","slot":"1661846400000__1661871600000","track":"208826eb-ec6e-4dc0-9c4a-c480968bbe2c","themes":[],"title":{"en":"Making together across space and time"},"content":{"en":"**Making Together Across Space & Time: Mapping Participatory Making when Co-Designing Asynchronously and/or without Colocation**\n\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/spaceandtimeworkshop/\n\n\n**_Kiersten Hay_**\nUniversity of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom\n[khay3@ed.ac.uk](mailto:khay3@ed.ac.uk)\n\n\n**_Larissa Pschetz_**\nUniversity of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom\n[l.pschetz@ed.ac.uk](mailto:l.pschetz@ed.ac.uk)\n\n\n**_Nantia Koulidou_**\nSheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, United Kingdom\n[n.koulidou@shu.ac.uk](mailto:n.koulidou@shu.ac.uk)\n\n\n**_Caroline Claisse_**\nNewcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom\n[caroline.claisse@newcastle.ac.uk](mailto:caroline.claisse@newcastle.ac.uk)\n\n\n**_Thomas Dylan_**\nNorthumbria University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom\n[thomas.dylan@northumbria.ac.uk](mailto:thomas.dylan@northumbria.ac.uk)\n\n\n**_Billy Dixon_**\nUniversity of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom\n[billy.dixon@ed.ac.uk](mailto:billy.dixon@ed.ac.uk)\n\n\n**_Henry Collingham_**\nNorthumbria University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom\n[henry.w.r.collingham@northumbria.ac.uk](mailto:henry.w.r.collingham@northumbria.ac.uk)\n\n\n**_Bettina Nissen_**\nUniversity of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom\n[bettina.nissen@ed.ac.uk](mailto:bettina.nissen@ed.ac.uk)\n\n\nDesigners construct a material sensibility through ‘making’ within a design process; a sensibility which is co-constructed by giving shape to artefacts and systems together with other stakeholders in a participatory design process. Complex research contexts have required reconsideration of the ways in which this ‘making’ takes place. Particularly during recent pandemics, requirements of having to collaborate across different places and/or time periods prompted designers to adapt their praxes, generating reflective insight into how the materiality of participatory making (which includes sketches, toolkits, probes, samples, role play performances, prototypes, and others) may support or challenge the co-construction of shared material sensibilities. In this workshop, we invite PD designers and researchers to reflect on and play with the materiality of participatory making while apart in order to co-create a constellation or network of design practices, materials, and audiences which can provide important insights for designers who face restrictions on meeting stakeholders face-to-face.\n\n\n\n"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":["513be77b-a1ca-48c5-95e6-48caf48ed102","75585250-b5f3-4d5d-bcb5-8ddd2f64f31a","a0fa2f67-0f8a-4b25-9033-12d024f8b6ac","e42bc2ee-d573-4d8f-bb10-148eff9b6ec2","de3a3207-e3fe-4ae6-9ac9-facd18f59f1e","62e3d2bd-01a5-4b92-8ff3-9e3b742815df","f8c207a9-30f1-4244-8a33-36ae15698150","f24e62a5-2f3a-478d-8ccb-167911053b7c"],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":false,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":false,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"f8ca5a7e-d24c-4420-8d30-39a99ec6a4e5","type":"8d54cbe3-b7ae-467e-90dd-7dda601e2fc1","slot":"1661850000000__1661871600000","track":"208826eb-ec6e-4dc0-9c4a-c480968bbe2c","themes":["319f6e09-8d5b-4900-a96e-e6c65c48f8c4","de139d36-a68d-458a-b6fe-ef571a584a00","cbe43eab-d37f-4276-a154-cfcc2584f83c","802450f5-9487-409a-b691-72e82ba4262e","c960c775-135e-403e-bc09-090b0c0bff4c"],"title":{"en":"Shared endeavours - Exploring Elinor Ostrom’s principles for collaborative group working from a contemporary design perspective"},"content":{"en":"**Shared endeavours: Exploring Elinor Ostrom’s principles for collaborative group working from a contemporary design perspective**\n\n\nhttps://www.collaborativegroupworking.com/\n\n\n**_Bertil Lindenfalk_**\nJönköping Academy for Improvement of Health and Welfare, School of\nHealth and Welfare, Jönköping University, Jönköping,, Sweden,\n[bertil.lindenfalk@ju.se](mailto:bertil.lindenfalk@ju.se)\n\n\n**_Oli Williams_**\nFlorence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery & Palliative Care, King’s College London, London,, UK,\n[oli.williams@kcl.ac.uk](mailto:oli.williams@kcl.ac.uk)\n\n\n**_Glenn Robert_**\nFlorence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery & Palliative Care, King’s College London, London,, UK,\n[glenn.robert@kcl.ac.uk](mailto:glenn.robert@kcl.ac.uk)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis workshop invites participatory design practitioners and researchers to explore how Ostrom’s 8 principles for collaborative group working can aid designers during the design process.

The workshop follows previous work conducted in a co design and quality improvement context where the relationships between the principles were highlighted.

These have emerged from a need to develop joint perspectives, a joint language and technological imagination as prerequisites for participatory approaches and co-design. For this workshop, we invite researchers, practitioners and designers who are working in settings that are socially and culturally diverse, who bring together people of a broad age range and who have tried creative approaches in their co-design activities. Working in groups to co-design and further develop creative entrances, this workshop will explore and reflect upon the potential of design fiction, storytelling, and games to foster creativity in co-design activities and to support (technological) imagination. As a result, we plan to co-host together with the participants a digital\nexhibition with the results of the workshop.\n\n\n\n"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":["1a83dcde-0412-4e1a-8372-24da68943bb5","38d23c16-c80e-43f7-8976-b1c5de249062","86ec1f70-8a5b-4f6b-8722-be4d8f9b7fcf","93191e44-9542-4f10-8045-658256ac7fcb","d558eec8-a0ff-4993-adb3-14d0fbc886e5","65e71d3f-f6f4-4b7b-bc97-cb4978af5074","42cbc9dd-3baa-42d9-a4a2-8da3fb5dd367"],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":false,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":false,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"3df50786-dba9-4382-a670-99896489229b","type":"8d54cbe3-b7ae-467e-90dd-7dda601e2fc1","slot":"1661868000000__1661878800000","track":"208826eb-ec6e-4dc0-9c4a-c480968bbe2c","themes":[],"title":{"en":"Phenomena: Co-Designing Planetary Care Through Joy (Session 2)"},"content":{"en":"**Phenomena: Co-Designing Planetary Care Through Joy**\n\n\nhttps://www.phenomena.cloud/workshops\n\n\n**_Ruth Isabel D.

Within this framework, fear becomes the catalyst for change. But how can we be certain that our solutions will lead to positive outcomes? PHENOMENA is a world-building tool and experience that approaches caring for our planet through the radical act of joy. This workshop fosters open collaboration among teams through participatory design (PD) approaches and situates play as central to the design process. It is intended to offer an alternative design methodology, establish meaningful connections with our planet, and democratize the pursuit of solving world problems. Workshop sessions are open to anyone interested in this topic, preferably those from interdisciplinary and multicultural backgrounds. Participants should be open to playing games and engaging in physical theatre within a group setting.\n\n\n[Please note this session is linked to a further session on the same day 9am - 12 pm BST.](https://schedule.pdc2022.org/https://schedule.pdc2022.org/session/2f178f96-427d-4928-8577-3665a12ce947) \n\n\n\n"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":["d2ac5974-d0ef-4e00-a349-644271fc19a8"],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":false,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":false,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"187dd876-6881-4f86-b67d-f0b8701cfd30","type":"8d54cbe3-b7ae-467e-90dd-7dda601e2fc1","slot":"1661871600000__1661886000000","track":"208826eb-ec6e-4dc0-9c4a-c480968bbe2c","themes":[],"title":{"en":"Justice-oriented participatory electronic-textile making"},"content":{"en":"**Justice-oriented Participatory Electronic Textile Making: Fostering shared spaces of knowledge dialogues through the process of making, un-making, and re-making justice-oriented participatory praxis**\n\n\n[https://www.artesanaltecnologica.org/pdc_2022_workshop/](https://www.artesanaltecnologica.org/pdc_2022_workshop/)\n\n\n**_Angelika Strohmayer *_**\nSchool of Design, Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK\n[angelika.strohmayer@northumbria.ac.uk](mailto:angelika.strohmayer@northumbria.ac.uk)\n\n\n**_Laura Cortés Rico_**\nMultimedia Engineering, Universidad Militar Nueva Granada, Colombia\n[laura.cortes@unimilitar.edu.co](mailto:laura.cortes@unimilitar.edu.co)\n\n\n**_Tania Pérez-Bustos_**\nSchool of Gender Studies, National University of Colombia, Colombia\n[tcperezb@unal.edu.co](mailto:tcperezb@unal.edu.co)\n\n\n**_Afroditi Psarra_**\nDigital Arts and Experimental Media, University of Washington, USA\n[apsarra@uw.edu](mailto:apsarra@uw.edu)\n\n\n**_Daniela Rosner_**\nHuman Centered Design and Engineering, University of Washington, USA\n[dkrosner@uw.edu](mailto:dkrosner@uw.edu)\n\n\n**_Özge Subaşı_**\nMedia and Visual Arts, Koç University, Turkey\n[ozsubasi@ku.edu.tr](mailto:ozsubasi@ku.edu.tr)\n\n\n**_Irene Posch_**\nDesign and Technology, University of Art and Design, Linz, Austria\n[irene.posch@ufg.at](mailto:irene.posch@ufg.at)\n\n\n**_Sara Nabil_**\nHCI, Queen’s University, Ontario, Canada\n[sara.nabil@queensu.ca](mailto:sara.nabil@queensu.ca)\n\n\n**_Jihan Sherman_**\nGeorgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, USA\n[jihansherman@gatech.edu](mailto:jihansherman@gatech.edu)\n\n\n\nParticipatory Design and Participatory Textiles Practices have only recently begun to address their shared roots in notions of solidarity and community-building, as well as movements towards more just worlds.

The project explores how forests and forest data can be produced, thought of and engaged with otherwise, in co-creative ways that consider perspectives of diverse forest creatures and reach beyond geo-engineering, techno-solutionist perspectives. In this Situated Action, we build on our previous Open Forest activities organized in different parts of the world and take an experimental, hybrid walk in a local forest area in Newcastle followed by a co-creation of forest stories. Through these engagements, we hope to entangle the existing, mostly quantitative forests datasets with more messy and abstract data to question the currently available understandings about the forest as a resource to be used. Our aim is to support collective imagination and care-full sustainability actions towards flourishing more-than-human futures.\n\n\n[**Join our hybrid walking event on 30th August**](https://schedule.pdc2022.org/session/4b5abf4a-a08e-4867-9de1-8eabcb69284c)\n\n\n<hr>\n\n### KN(eat)TING: Sharing the table, crafting knowledge\n\n\n**_Tomás Ignacio Corvalán Azócar_**\n\n\nKN(eat)TING: Sharing the table, crafting knowledge is an invitation to engage in shared practices that focus on the process more than the outcomes. As a situated action, this project seeks participants at PDC2022 to inhabit a safe space where conversations around the conference topics, together with questions, thoughts and lived experiences can be shared. This rehearsal of tomar once, Chilean tea ritual, explicitly focuses on furthering critical conversations through joint material production under decolonial, queer frame-works. There are two planned outcomes: One is the experience of engaging in a territory that focuses on the process as a site for analysis and crafting of knowledge. The second is the co-creation of knitted pieces, materialising how these dialogues have the potential to craft knowledge. This situated action proposes that design education can benefit from textile practices as means of engaged thinking with the senses, embracing and bolstering the power of territories that deviate from western ontologies.\n\n\nJoin the [**online event on 23rd August**](https://schedule.pdc2022.org/session/8786b88d-272c-4bbf-a2cc-31e807e478dc) or our [**in-person event on 30th August.**](https://schedule.pdc2022.org/session/f721277e-82f3-43ea-b76b-d632729dea7d) \n\n\n<hr>\n\n### Co-Creating a Virtuous Cycle Fostering Citizenship: Alliances through Making and Gifting\n\n\n**_Henry Collingham, Jayne Wallace, Jill Brewster, Rickard Whittingham, Sebastian Prost, Justin Marshall, Will Benson, Michelle Kindleysides_**\n\n\nWe present a short film following the creation of four co-designed objects which were gifted between participants from two community groups, a group of older men living with conditions affecting their mental health, including dementia, and a group of children based in a typically disadvantaged neighborhood in north east England. Over 10 weeks, these participants created unique wood-working projects, each group working to improve the lives of the other, while gaining new creative skills, and establishing a ‘virtuous cycle’ of reflection and praxis. In the spirit of the film, we invite participants to create a design proposal for a fellow delegate in return for their own bespoke design, in a co-design ‘secret Santa’. We aim to reveal ways in which we can hope to be seen and come to understand artful ways of seeing, through a new virtuous cycle.\n\n\nTake part in our [**online event until 12th August**](https://schedule.pdc2022.org/session/b8e88d84-9e44-478e-8440-2ccf5ae52346) or join us [**in-person on 30th August**](https://schedule.pdc2022.org/session/43dfa409-1169-4e00-86a0-3a04f9a1d210)**.**\n\n\n<hr>\n\n### The Objects We Carry; The Memories We Share Recollecting Collective Memories through Participatory Stop-motion with Personal Objects\n\n\n**_Nairy Eivazy, Jan Peeters, Sandy Claes_**\n\n\nAnimated film can contribute to evoking and sharing the memories that are embodied by objects. Diaspora communities who are dispersed all over the world, such as the Armenian diaspora, maintain a myth or collective memory of their homeland. They carry objects with them that are representative of their roots and create a sense of belonging alongside objects that depict their everyday life and multicultural identity. Through their tangible and tacit aspects, these objects include rich stories that can be made visible through stop-motion photography, made in collaboration with community members who have no experience in film-making. We learned that the participatory animation approach and the resulting animation can support a collective expression and understanding. In this situated action and exhibition installation, we will present this participatory animation approach and resulting animated film.\n\n\n[**Join our in-person event on 31st August**](https://schedule.pdc2022.org/session/37083a5c-4e61-480e-bf10-59678770525e)**.**\n\n\n<hr>\n\n### Zineography: Exploring the Participatory Design Process of Collaborative Zine Making\n\n\n**_Kiersten Hay_**\n\n\nZines (as in magazines) are self-published publications that are often created, produced, and distributed by their author(s). When mem-bers of a community of interest co-create zines together, they con-struct narratives through their editorial juxtaposition and styling of individual contributions on a given topic. While zines are in-creasingly being used in the HCI field as a medium or format for knowledge-sharing and/or community-building, collaborative zinemaking is less explored as a participatory design process that may illuminate both individual and shared narratives.Zineographyisan unfolding exhibit of the process of collaborative zine making,through which PDC 2022 attendees are invited to creatively con-tribute and collaborate on zines exploring personal experiences related to conference themes. Zineography highlights how collaborative zine making can operate as a participatory design process that retains the plurality of individual expressions while facilitating the co-construction of shared narratives through editorial design practices.

A key aspect at the center of this community’s practice has been research and design exploration in the context of Information and Communication Technologies. Since the 1990s the PDC community has investigated Participatory Design (PD) practice in diverse and multi-faceted directions - from work fo-cused on accountability and user involvement in the design process to best processes and tools to enable diverse stakeholders to engage in co-design activities, experimental innovation and open-ended processes, PD practice decolonization and pluriversality in PD practice to name a few examples. Over the past three decades PD practice evolved greatly, as did its community. However, while PD practice and its evolution is doc-umented, our understanding and documentation of how the PD community itself evolved over time is limited. This Situated Action focuses on an effort to deepen our understanding of the PD community by leveraging PD practice and actively involving the community in depicting (and, in the process, critiquing) its own profile.\n\n\n[**Join our online event 31st August.**](https://schedule.pdc2022.org/session/248bbe4a-15c4-47a2-9e95-09ace5db66f8)\n\n\n<hr>\n\n### Pass the parcel: visualizing environmental action across global sites\n\n\n**_Michael Chew_**\n\n\nI propose participatory photographic exchanges between geographically distributed urban sites as a means of visualizing local environmental actions in a global context. The situated actions draw upon participatory methods developed in the action-research PhD project Portraits of Change. Hybrid/Online workshops will invite participants attending PDC both in person and online and potentially additional PDC Places to successively photograph representations of locally-situated environmental actions and pass them onto the next site with an invitation for the next participants to creatively respond to these images, iteratively building up a multi-layered visual exchange. These representations will be linked to environmental action through participants being invited to make online commitments and provocations on their choices of environmental actions inspired by the exchange. This highlights the limitations of dominant simplistic, individualistic approaches to environmental change, whilst representing the complexity, tensions, and global interconnectedness that lie behind these changes, as well as opening up spaces to inspire environmental change.\n\n\n[**Join our online event on 25th August**](https://schedule.pdc2022.org/session/3ebee254-8378-497d-9e49-a51dbd6425d7) or our [**hybrid event on 30th August.**](https://schedule.pdc2022.org/session/64ebcfdd-459a-4b70-a7f5-2bd8079c480c) \n\n\n<hr>\n\n### Ripple: A Role-Playing Game (RPG) that Shifts Power Dynamics in Healthcare\n\n\n**_Kim Burgas, Hrudaya Veena Yanamandala_**\n\n\n_Ripple_ invites participants into a role-playing game (RPG) to shift traditional power dynamics seen within healthcare systems in the United States and to unpack ‘intangible’ non-clinical needs that aren’t easily communicated or identified even with participatory approaches. Through this RPG, participants will explore fictional worlds and scenarios through three acts: 1. exploring oneself through individual character building, 2. exploring the relationships of those in the community of individuals, 3. navigating scenarios and storytelling together. As a prototype _Ripple_ will help to understand the value of RPGs in participatory design and to understand the ‘invisible’ needs beyond treatment needs in a cancer patient and their caregivers’ journey.\n\n\nJoin our online event on [**25th August**](https://schedule.pdc2022.org/session/d8baeb66-b8af-4c87-9814-8afeff83db1a) or [**31st August.**](https://schedule.pdc2022.org/session/b94d850a-2c4e-47ff-85a6-5f748a828a90) \n"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":[],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":false,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":false,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"3e7afedf-cc2d-4669-9bb4-67951f23f07e","type":"769a990c-4055-41af-8666-56b35dce543f","slot":"1661930100000__1661931900000","track":"208826eb-ec6e-4dc0-9c4a-c480968bbe2c","themes":[],"title":{"en":"Welcome to Newcastle Upon Tyne (UK)"},"content":{"en":"The General Conference chairs welcome the online and in-person attendees to the Newcastle upon Tyne (UK) programme.

This panel aims to debate, provoke and anticipate what our approaches to understanding and responding to our differences are and what they could be in the future. PD projects inevitably require us to navigate and acknowledge difference, whether this be recognising cultural, racial, gendered, economic, expertise, geographic, status, or hierarchy. It is also widely recognised that differences are assigned to form categories which can be mutable, prescriptive or stereotyped. \n\n\nThe panellists will speak to these issues in relation to their own projects on decolonising, working with local traditions, multi-cultural relations and mapping transitions.

The process of ‘making’ aids participants in expressing tacit knowledge and surface assumptions that are often difficult to identify by other means. The collaborative process of making and creating together gives agency to excluded voices and promotes socially inclusive practices. Artefacts and prototypes are thus valuable in eliciting deep user insights through conceptual, procedural and emotional probes, bringing out preconceptions and assumptions. Artefacts act like ‘boundary objects’ that bridge gaps in knowledge, perception and experience with a tangible form of expression, creating a shared knowledge and understanding of participants from different backgrounds and experiences. This workshop seeks to explore the use of boundary objects in prototyping in identifying issues of limited usage of public transport by females in India.\n\n\nThis workshop will run in-person as part of [PDC Places India](https://sites.google.com/view/boundaryobjects/pdc-place?authuser=0) at the National Institute of Design, Paldi, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.

There are also many challenges facing our research teams more generally; increased workloads, poor mental health and wellbeing, challenging work environments, institutional capability, staff retention and lack of accountability within our management structures. Many leaders who are in positions of power and are able and capable of supporting such endeavours don’t always provide adequate resources for such work or don’t recognise the levels of complexity and innovation required to work through systemic structures of inequity for such events. These present persistent challenges for those who take on these multifarious forms of nuanced labour.\n\n\n### **Is the conference and publishing system broken?** \n\n\nWe invite open discussion through a panel of design experts experienced in running conferences, across multiple platforms - in-person, online and hybrid - to outline challenges and approaches to overcoming barriers, navigating structural inequity, getting things done or deciding which spinning plates are likely and OK to smash. We invite panellists and the wider community to debate, speculate, provoke and anticipate what the future of running and experiencing conferences in a more participatory way could be, while responding to the ongoing challenges of excessive unpaid labour, burnout, navigating risk and possible failure.\n\n\n**How do we ensure we open up conferences, reviewing and publishing to become more than sites of privilege?**\n\n\n**How do we educate ourselves in the economics and logistics of inclusion, diversity and plurality?**  \n\n\n**What are the benefits of being part of a conference community or organising committee? For example, how are the promises of being “good for our careers” fulfilled, if at all?** \n\n\n**How do we account for hours of invisible labour when hosting, reviewing, organising for a conference?** \n"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en","es","pt"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":["3922a782-a923-4f01-b5d9-0d8bd562b3a4","01e7db89-db88-4cf0-afcb-ea088ee2e0b4","f96217f1-f0d2-424b-a399-91ed12b6988e","ab04725b-51b4-4e99-96cf-823d441a7121","ad529df2-1d7a-4ded-ac91-e6f499da695c","68d82909-5658-4631-a194-fa08eb9d8795","dd2da121-9372-4d72-88e2-6c1d5cc160fd","7b6f03ed-b5f6-4e52-9b98-dcaf279f5cd0","66741cd3-fe24-4473-bd8d-9598f289c8d9"],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":true,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":true,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"59c76482-dc93-4c46-baeb-45724fcd08f8","type":"769a990c-4055-41af-8666-56b35dce543f","slot":"1662051600000__1662053400000","track":"208826eb-ec6e-4dc0-9c4a-c480968bbe2c","themes":[],"title":{"en":"Closing Plenary"},"content":{"en":""},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":[],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":false,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":false,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"6fa16488-64ba-4a18-9d40-f636db7c6dec","type":"769a990c-4055-41af-8666-56b35dce543f","slot":"1652876100000__1652881500000","track":"fb858d34-9492-4596-b5e9-20b9a6e035f2","themes":["ad8aa6fe-7162-4937-bf62-07871a82b64d"],"title":{"en":"PDC Place Germany: Guest Lecture Sara Reimann"},"content":{"en":"Based at the Institute for Urban and Cultural Area Research (IFSK) at Leuphana University in Lüneburg, Germany, the PDC Place will be launched in the pre-conference period.

Honey, aromatic flowers, sweet corn and chili were just some of the ingredients that used to flavour the sparkling glasses of chocolate served among the Nahua, Mayan or Mixtec elites. In this keynote, different preparations of this drink will be explored, based on epigraphic data, for the Mayan case; and through the analysis of 16th century sources, for the Nahua case. Finally, the emphasis will be on the contexts of its consumption, the most appreciated flavours by the indigenous nobility, and on the place of chocolate in the Mesoamerican worldview \n\nThe keynote will be delivered by Elena Mazzetto.

We will speak with anthropologists, chocolate producers, traditional cooks and people about their experiences, exploratory design, and nourishment of body and minds.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Location**\nOnline:\n\n\nZoom Meeting\n[https://cuaieed-unam.zoom.us/j/3806929329?pwd=a3hjSmVKQXlpeXhTZURva1Zmbkl6QT09](https://cuaieed-unam.zoom.us/j/3806929329?pwd=a3hjSmVKQXlpeXhTZURva1Zmbkl6QT09)\nMeeting ID: 380 692 9329\nPasscode: 789002\n\n\n**For more information**\n[mexicopdcplace@gmail.com](mailto:mexicopdcplace@gmail.com)\n"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["es"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":[],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":false,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":false,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"0567f0ed-f087-4d5a-b0c2-d26852687ff2","type":"e8ad11ab-0eda-42cb-a65d-f5ace7b65f4f","slot":"1660671000000__1660672800000","track":"fb858d34-9492-4596-b5e9-20b9a6e035f2","themes":["ebdb165e-219e-493e-a037-034ef5afdc28","de139d36-a68d-458a-b6fe-ef571a584a00","a59d2b85-c9bf-4bda-b5af-bf43180202ef"],"title":{"en":"A story about chocolate: Discussion (Una historia del chocolate: discusión)"},"content":{"en":"We will host a hybrid event which will include a face-to-face panel with participants from the A story about chocolate documentaries as well as online guests.

I propose that through an understanding of culture as that which emerges through relations, which are themselves constituted through scalar movements between concepts, subjects etc., rather than as something essential - an understanding of culture as emerging from ‘dialogues of difference’ - is a fruitful way with which to begin to think participation and the forging of both local and global solidarities in modern, cosmopolitan societies. \n\n\nThe longer version of the keynote can be [accessed via the link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-aJk2LivHjrYuthaQLbgfoe4oiL2eFVryvj0NHuJdUA/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n\nAhmed Ansari is an Industry Assistant Professor at New York University at the Integrated Digital Media program in the department of Technology, Culture & Society, where he teaches courses in interaction and systemic design, design research, and design studies, and directs the PhD program in Human-Centered Design, Technology and Innovation. His interests intersect between critical design studies and history, postcolonial and decolonial theory, and the philosophy and history of design and technology with an area focus on the Indian subcontinent. He is a founder of the Decolonising Design platform and the Architectural Design Research Lab in Karachi, and also does academic consulting focusing on curriculum development at the undergraduate level, having designed curricula for design programs at the Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture (IVSAA) and Habib University (HU) in Karachi. More recently, he has been working on an [NEH grant](https://nyuhumanities.org/program/inverting-the-wunderkammer/) that brings together perspectives from the natural sciences, humanities, and design on the smallest of things, moss, in order to rethink how we might redesign public digital humanities archives. Dr. Ansari received his PhD in Design Studies and MDes in Interaction Design from Carnegie Mellon University, and his BDes in Communication Design from IVSAA.\n\n\n\n"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":["a93a4f51-590f-4296-ac91-6041dcc485b1"],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":true,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":true,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"51a01516-97ba-4e8c-a648-5405eae4c584","type":"27a19476-d967-40e1-acc5-b35140e5c889","slot":"1660906800000__1660914000000","track":"fb858d34-9492-4596-b5e9-20b9a6e035f2","themes":["de139d36-a68d-458a-b6fe-ef571a584a00"],"title":{"en":"Exhibition Behind the Scenes"},"content":{"en":"A visual documentation of how the curation of Poster Exhibition is coming up.\n\n\n\n**Location**\nOnline via Zoom\n\n\n**For more information**\n[pdcplaceindia@nid.edu](mailto:pdcplaceindia@nid.edu)\n"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":[],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":false,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":false,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"ebf775a0-da06-4f4b-8ce8-1cdf42bba4fd","type":"e8ad11ab-0eda-42cb-a65d-f5ace7b65f4f","slot":"1660917600000__1660924800000","track":"fb858d34-9492-4596-b5e9-20b9a6e035f2","themes":["cbe43eab-d37f-4276-a154-cfcc2584f83c","9a65fee9-bcbd-4686-86ad-0091c6dbb904","27adc9c4-fbfb-4bc3-a3be-7e53affa2f97","26f0b76d-66dd-4ae3-82d1-a12196dd17ca","7dc0b465-4fa6-4a22-a17d-33f590b4c104","d3479271-f902-4504-95c1-a7c468befb10","18b5579c-ff90-432c-a323-9ae6f3ad33ef","5e46b09a-c19b-4c1a-b244-a82dd586fb4c","3abc6877-587f-4104-b035-4b0420865d26","4e1e9ad1-035d-4281-8ea6-beb78bbfa456","802450f5-9487-409a-b691-72e82ba4262e","c960c775-135e-403e-bc09-090b0c0bff4c","60b152ab-f8c0-47d5-aff6-0d396f19a71e","ad8aa6fe-7162-4937-bf62-07871a82b64d","ebdb165e-219e-493e-a037-034ef5afdc28","319f6e09-8d5b-4900-a96e-e6c65c48f8c4","de139d36-a68d-458a-b6fe-ef571a584a00","a59d2b85-c9bf-4bda-b5af-bf43180202ef"],"title":{"en":"Participatory Design in the Caribbean"},"content":{"en":"Virtual panel on PD in the Caribbean that will be open to those registered in the Participatory Design Conference.\n\n\n**Location**\nOnline via Zoom\n\n**For more information**\n[mmo@rubberbandpr.com](mailto:mmo@rubberbandpr.com)  \n"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["es","en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":[],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":false,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":false,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"543012ce-4353-4702-ac9e-3c854bb31bde","type":"41852ae7-b391-4972-aa37-a0d416f19769","slot":"1660919400000__1660923000000","track":"76eed8bf-9103-4c92-9a9e-fcd0007be2d5","themes":["4e1e9ad1-035d-4281-8ea6-beb78bbfa456","319f6e09-8d5b-4900-a96e-e6c65c48f8c4","c960c775-135e-403e-bc09-090b0c0bff4c"],"title":{"en":"Making vs Breaking Rules in Social Justice"},"content":{"en":"<div class=\"iframeEmbed\"><iframe class=\"iframeEmbed-iframe\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" title=\"YouTube video player\" allow=\"clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TxHZ682wQ-w\"></iframe></div>\n\nFor PDC 2022, our Beyond Academia sessions will focus on how practitioners tackle complex problems, emphasizing how they recover from mistakes, missteps and mishaps - both big and small.

In keeping with many of the themes that run through PDC2022, as well as emergent and contemporary themes in PD research and practice, the Doctoral Colloquium participants in 2022 are wrestling with and pushing forward critical conversations about and engagements with positionality, ethics, ideas of empathy and abilities of participatory practices in a range of settings, across the world. The Doctoral Colloquium participants are located in different areas of the world (Europe, Australia, USA, Russia, South Korea), reflecting a cultural diversity that is manifested in their approach to and engagement with PD. The PDC 2022 Doctoral Colloquium will take the form of a series of distributed online sessions that provide students with a safe and open space to discuss what matters to them concerning their studies, and collaboratively seek ways to address them. Participants share their work and experiences, receive feedback, support, and suggestions from experienced PD researchers and peers.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Empathy in participatory design: using empathy\nin design justice-focused practice\n\n\n**_Elyse Girard_**\n\n\n## A “Warm City”: The concept of comfortable urban\nenvironment for the Arctic (with reference to Western Siberia\n\n\n**_Sofia Prokopova_**\n\n\n## Understanding the influence of empathy on the\nproduction process of animated video content - User classification inside and outside the animation production pipeline\n\n\n**_Hui Meng_**\n\n\n## Development of handover approaches in design\nfor dementia\n\n\n**_Lieke Lenaerts_**\n\n\n## Participatory design processes and renewable energy practices: Community perspectives from the Global South\n\n\n**_Manisha Rayaprolu_**\n\n\n## Exploring the Transformation of Making Practices\nin Culture: Felting as a More-than-Human Design Activity\n\n\n**_Berilsu Tarcan_**\n\n\n## Contesting Design: Ancestral Technology as Portal\nto Post-Design\n\n\n**_Pedro Reynolds-Cuéllar_**\n\n\n## Urban landscape co-design for resilient public\nspaces: A framework for the design process\n\n\n**_Macarena Gaete Cruz_**\n\n\n## Published paper\n\n\n<a class=\"button is-primary\" download=\"paper.pdf\" href=\"https://pdc-2022.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/notion/y4ZiXYehwHYm4_duFuLETHOww1fdP5NjEIsBzFWFLbc.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download PDF →</a>\n\n\n"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":["fc2c4cab-073a-469e-b538-9a02af69717b","f8c1f4f1-a79c-468d-941c-a44339afa336","987b49c4-9709-4d20-8ba9-324af9c72799","52ef67ef-7b8f-4612-bd9d-2f1af4879062"],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":false,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":false,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"6485c21a-5148-4fdc-b320-60133726b50b","type":"85f15465-d0c3-478c-b61c-805159aabe6c","slot":"1661144400000__1661149800000","track":"fb858d34-9492-4596-b5e9-20b9a6e035f2","themes":["ebdb165e-219e-493e-a037-034ef5afdc28","a59d2b85-c9bf-4bda-b5af-bf43180202ef"],"title":{"en":"Ngā Aho Kōrero"},"content":{"en":"<div class=\"iframeEmbed\"><iframe class=\"iframeEmbed-iframe\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" title=\"YouTube video player\" allow=\"clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1QU1ajYDEuQ\"></iframe></div>\n\nStories from Ngā Aho - gathering indigenous practitioners and nurturing networks through whakawhanaungatanga - relationship building.

The workshop will bring together academics, researchers and practitioners to share their experiences, expertise and visions for: (1) evolving participatory design approaches to move beyond the individual; (2) reinvigorating a stronger relationship between communities and institutions across different scales in order to re-politicise participatory design practices, projects and methods; and (3) making a concerted effort of contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We are specifically interested in ways of ‘designing smart’ by engaging and working with communities to address complex challenges, such as social inequality, economic disparity and environmental degradation to build more sustainable, resilient and socially ‘just’ communities.\n\n\n\n"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":["3c9f84ef-eb48-4750-8a6b-97c4e62edf14","6654c696-6491-457a-828a-92bdfc9cb072","310c5efe-e9f1-4678-9ed0-1659aed03e27","e58fd3a2-9727-41f8-91f2-5307e2073538","6d195cfc-f963-496b-824f-51fd3235d253","7fec086d-e83b-4f24-ace4-8b43be902545"],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":false,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":false,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"2022edcd-82ef-44a3-9528-5bbe0d2f7227","type":"e8ad11ab-0eda-42cb-a65d-f5ace7b65f4f","slot":"1661403600000__1661410800000","track":"fb858d34-9492-4596-b5e9-20b9a6e035f2","themes":["ebdb165e-219e-493e-a037-034ef5afdc28","a59d2b85-c9bf-4bda-b5af-bf43180202ef","26f0b76d-66dd-4ae3-82d1-a12196dd17ca","60b152ab-f8c0-47d5-aff6-0d396f19a71e"],"title":{"en":"Kōrero: How does connection to Place impact our participatory design work in Tāmaki Makaurau?"},"content":{"en":"<div class=\"iframeEmbed\"><iframe class=\"iframeEmbed-iframe\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" title=\"YouTube video player\" allow=\"clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z55f5FKJCeo\"></iframe></div>\n\nHow does connection to Place impact our participatory design work in Tāmaki Makaurau?

The hybrid/Online workshops invite participants to create photographic representations of locally-situated environmental actions and pass them onto another site with an invitation for the next participants to creatively respond to these images, iteratively building up a multi-layered visual exchange. These representations will be linked to environmental action through participants being invited to make online commitments and provocations on their choices of environmental actions inspired by the exchange.\n\n\n\n\n\n**_Michael Chew_**\n\n\nLocation: Zoom\n\n\n[**Register for this event**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pdc-22-situated-action-pass-the-parcel-online-tickets-377759317287)\n\n\n[**https://www.ecoimagine.org/projects**](https://www.ecoimagine.org/projects)\n\n\n## Keywords\n\n\nphotovoice, environmental behaviour, multi-sited ethnography\n\n\n\n\n\n<a class=\"button is-primary\" download=\"paper.pdf\" href=\"https://pdc-2022.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/notion/pp0maTzVxU33dVQRNlLKDWGttk4gyt7YN5XOITrZSx8.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download PDF →</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":["6dd0cca4-330f-40e5-9509-356ea6f9474e"],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":false,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":false,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"d8baeb66-b8af-4c87-9814-8afeff83db1a","type":"378d5ffb-19fa-461c-bc8c-11b21c7d7216","slot":"1661425200000__1661436000000","track":"76eed8bf-9103-4c92-9a9e-fcd0007be2d5","themes":[],"title":{"en":"Ripple: A Role-Playing Game (RPG) that Shifts Power Dynamics in Healthcare (session 1)"},"content":{"en":"<figure><img src=\"https://pdc-2022.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/notion/8aLrB0A7ET0fCllFp4Og1LVR1MTUM8fLXaBDPc9VOts.png\"></figure>\n\n_Ripple_ invites participants into a role-playing game (RPG) to shift traditional power dynamics seen within healthcare systems in the United States and to unpack ‘intangible’ non-clinical needs that aren’t easily communicated or identified even with a participatory design approach. Through this RPG, participants will explore fictional worlds and scenarios through three acts: 1. Exploring oneself through individual character building, 2. exploring the relationships of those in the community of individuals, 3. navigating scenarios and storytelling together. As a prototype  _Ripple_ will help to understand the value of RPGs in participatory design and to understand the ‘invisible’ needs beyond treatment needs in a cancer patient and their caregivers’ journey.\n\n\n**_Kim Burgas, Hrudaya Veena Yanamandala_**\n\n\nLocation: Zoom\n\n\n[**Register for this event**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pdc-22-situated-action-ripple-online-tickets-377280344667)\n\n\n\n\n\n[**https://mcfarlandbooks.com/product/the-functions-of-role-playing-games/**](https://mcfarlandbooks.com/product/the-functions-of-role-playing-games/)\n\n\n[**https://sharkbombs.itch.io/ex-novo**](https://sharkbombs.itch.io/ex-novo) **** \n\n\n[**https://laurieoconnel.itch.io/lichcraft**](https://laurieoconnel.itch.io/lichcraft)\n\n\n## Keywords\n\n\nParticipation, role-playing, role-playing games, RPG, participatory design, healthcare, care, design research, prototyping\n\n\n\n\n\n<a class=\"button is-primary\" download=\"paper.pdf\" href=\"https://pdc-2022.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/notion/7e1K5e2asN07YnwOZtc_njA7kDbahpkaHZYhIYbn6lY.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download PDF →</a>\n\n\n"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":["cdbbd1ac-e744-4576-b18c-c67eb7795af3","21c01d32-6f91-4c9d-8f1e-096ee3598f00"],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":false,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":false,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"2c943e04-08f1-4e4c-b756-fc7f8bacfb91","type":"b7e8616a-bcc9-4d06-9e10-7268e1e17a9d","slot":"1661440500000__1661446800000","track":"76eed8bf-9103-4c92-9a9e-fcd0007be2d5","themes":["9a65fee9-bcbd-4686-86ad-0091c6dbb904","c960c775-135e-403e-bc09-090b0c0bff4c","cbe43eab-d37f-4276-a154-cfcc2584f83c","319f6e09-8d5b-4900-a96e-e6c65c48f8c4","7dc0b465-4fa6-4a22-a17d-33f590b4c104","ebdb165e-219e-493e-a037-034ef5afdc28","26f0b76d-66dd-4ae3-82d1-a12196dd17ca","27adc9c4-fbfb-4bc3-a3be-7e53affa2f97"],"title":{"en":"Expanding literacies in plural justices"},"content":{"en":"<div class=\"iframeEmbed\"><iframe class=\"iframeEmbed-iframe\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" title=\"YouTube video player\" allow=\"clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DEF2aeHDzvc\"></iframe></div>\n\n### Reviews Gone South: A Subversive Experiment on Participatory Design Canons\n\n\nPedro Reynolds-Cuéllar, Bibiana Oliveira Serpa, Claudia Grisales, Julián “Iñaki” Goñi, Marisol Wong-Villacrés, Oscar A.

first-person report from a large participatory-action-research-design project where we are using the principles of data feminism to co-design technology with data activists. The \"we\" in question is myself, Silvana Fumega, and Helena Suárez Val, and we work in collaboration and solidarity with activist groups producing data to challenge feminicide - fatal gender-related violence against women - across the Americas. As all practitioners know, practice is messy and rarely adheres cleanly to pleasing principles. Throughout the talk, I will highlight resonances and tensions between our design process and the principles of data feminism, showing how we tried to operationalize these principles in interactive digital tools and machine learning classifiers. But it's not all heroic. I hope to surface my lingering questions to the community so that we may think together about the limitations of designing for justice in hostile political economies.\n\n\n\n\n\nCatherine D’Ignazio is a scholar, artist/designer and hacker mama who focuses on feminist technology and data justice. She has run [reproductive justice hackathons](https://kanarinka.github.io/makethebreastpumpnotsuck/), designed global news recommendation systems, and created talking and tweeting water quality sculptures. With Rahul Bhargava, she built the platform [Databasic.io](https://databasic.io/en_GB/), a suite of tools and activities to introduce newcomers to data science. Her 2020 book from MIT Press, _Data Feminism_, co-authored with Lauren Klein, charts a course for more ethical and empowering data science practices. Since 2019, she has co-organized [Data Against Feminicide](https://datoscontrafeminicidio.net/en/home-2/), a participatory action-research-design project, with Silvana Fumega and Helena Suárez Val. D’Ignazio is an Associate Professor of Urban Science and Planning in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at MIT. She is also Director of the [Data + Feminism Lab](https://dataplusfeminism.mit.edu/) which uses data and computational methods to work towards gender and racial equity, particularly in relation to space and place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://pdc-2022.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/notion/OrX8OGO3da6kGFvlw9gv12-2wxAthG4pbr73KGMoGHI.png\"><figcaption>\n\nData Against Femicide Project.

Keeping food in the background and using textiles as facilitators, this rehearsal of the Chilean tea ritual of \"La Once\" focuses explicitly on conversations through making as a metaphor for the crafting of knowledge.\n\n\n**_Tomás Ignacio Corvalán Azócar_**\n\n\n**Location:**    [**Shieldfield Art Works (SAW)**](https://www.saw-newcastle.org/)**,** [**1 Clarence St, Shieldfield, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 1YH**](https://goo.gl/maps/iB6GL1MTr42p82rs9)\n\n\n[**Register for this event**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pdc2022-sa-kneatting-sharing-the-table-crafting-knowledge-tickets-377267205367?aff=odcleoeventsincollection) \n\n\n[**https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomascorvalanazocar/**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomascorvalanazocar/)\n\n\n## Keywords\n\n\nCritical textiles, Conversations, Crafting knowledge\n\n\n\n\n\n<a class=\"button is-primary\" download=\"paper.pdf\" href=\"https://pdc-2022.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/notion/Ia6jSX526elwuFhvKZgu3yPUgO5tSW30mJ8h9JLFylI.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download PDF →</a>"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":["efe070cd-a644-4a66-9969-84f3474f2676"],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":false,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":false,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"4b5abf4a-a08e-4867-9de1-8eabcb69284c","type":"378d5ffb-19fa-461c-bc8c-11b21c7d7216","slot":"1661860800000__1661868000000","track":"208826eb-ec6e-4dc0-9c4a-c480968bbe2c","themes":["3abc6877-587f-4104-b035-4b0420865d26","26f0b76d-66dd-4ae3-82d1-a12196dd17ca","4e1e9ad1-035d-4281-8ea6-beb78bbfa456"],"title":{"en":"Open Forest: Data, Stories, and Walking-With"},"content":{"en":"<figure><img src=\"https://pdc-2022.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/notion/d-BW1Sxp3UtomTQRZiPBLymhJfefG32jhcJcVrRyP9o.png\"></figure>\n\nOpen Forest is a collective, experimental inquiry into different forests and more-than-human dataflows. The project explores how forests and forest data can be produced, thought of and engaged with otherwise, in co-creative ways that consider perspectives of diverse forest creatures and reach beyond techno-solutionist perspectives. In Newcastle we will take an experimental, hybrid walk in the Ouseburn area followed by a co-creation of forest stories, following on our previous walks in other forests around the world. Through these engagements, we hope to entangle the existing, mostly quantitative forests datasets with more messy, abstract data to question the currently available understandings about the forest as a resource to be used.\n\n\n**_Markéta Dolejšová, Andrea Botero, Jaz Hee-Jeong Choi, Cristina Ampatzidou_**\n\n\n**Location**: [**Shieldfield Art Works (SAW)**](https://www.saw-newcastle.org/)**,** [**1 Clarence St, Shieldfield, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 1YH**](https://goo.gl/maps/iB6GL1MTr42p82rs9)\n\n\nAlso hybrid online via Zoom\n\n\n[**Register for this event**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pdc-22-situ-action-open-forest-data-stories-and-walking-with-hybrid-tickets-377281457997)\n\n\n[**https://more-than-human-derive.net/**](https://more-than-human-derive.net/)\n\n\n[**https://openforest.care/**](https://openforest.care/)\n\n\n[**https://creatures-eu.org/productions/open-forest/**](https://creatures-eu.org/productions/open-forest/)\n\n\n## Keywords\n\n\nForest, Forest data, Walking, Eco-social transformation, More-than-human\n\n\n\n\n\n<a class=\"button is-primary\" download=\"paper.pdf\" href=\"https://pdc-2022.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/notion/nBA1yVMXxgX2JEZGIM7iT6rprXIo0WHwbnKc-9GXza0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download PDF →</a>"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":["ecafc469-20dc-48b3-8a11-2129ac6cfc87","ae115178-22f4-4e57-971f-284bb6864630","ae1c32d8-b2a2-4b00-ad82-606b7377e58c","01e7db89-db88-4cf0-afcb-ea088ee2e0b4","a1734d0e-32af-45e8-84a1-1d7148cc2648"],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":false,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":false,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"597736c8-a31f-4672-9672-2663067896a5","type":"27a19476-d967-40e1-acc5-b35140e5c889","slot":"1661923800000__1662017400000","track":"fb858d34-9492-4596-b5e9-20b9a6e035f2","themes":["de139d36-a68d-458a-b6fe-ef571a584a00","26f0b76d-66dd-4ae3-82d1-a12196dd17ca","cbe43eab-d37f-4276-a154-cfcc2584f83c","a59d2b85-c9bf-4bda-b5af-bf43180202ef","9a65fee9-bcbd-4686-86ad-0091c6dbb904","60b152ab-f8c0-47d5-aff6-0d396f19a71e","c960c775-135e-403e-bc09-090b0c0bff4c","27adc9c4-fbfb-4bc3-a3be-7e53affa2f97","7dc0b465-4fa6-4a22-a17d-33f590b4c104","d3479271-f902-4504-95c1-a7c468befb10","ebdb165e-219e-493e-a037-034ef5afdc28","ad8aa6fe-7162-4937-bf62-07871a82b64d","319f6e09-8d5b-4900-a96e-e6c65c48f8c4","5e46b09a-c19b-4c1a-b244-a82dd586fb4c","3abc6877-587f-4104-b035-4b0420865d26","4e1e9ad1-035d-4281-8ea6-beb78bbfa456","18b5579c-ff90-432c-a323-9ae6f3ad33ef","802450f5-9487-409a-b691-72e82ba4262e"],"title":{"en":"Poster Exhibition: In-Person"},"content":{"en":"Poster Presentations of 5 mins per author will take place both online and offline.\n\n**Location**\nDesign Gallery, NID, Paldi, Ahmedabad 380007, India\n\n\n**For more information**\n[pdcplaceindia@nid.edu](mailto:pdcplaceindia@nid.edu)  \n"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":[],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":false,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":false,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"37083a5c-4e61-480e-bf10-59678770525e","type":"378d5ffb-19fa-461c-bc8c-11b21c7d7216","slot":"1661936400000__1661947200000","track":"36c5028b-87ce-4f67-b0da-070757eae16a","themes":["60b152ab-f8c0-47d5-aff6-0d396f19a71e","cbe43eab-d37f-4276-a154-cfcc2584f83c","27adc9c4-fbfb-4bc3-a3be-7e53affa2f97"],"title":{"en":"The Objects We Carry; The Memories We Share\nRecollecting Collective Memories through Participatory Stop-motion with Personal Objects"},"content":{"en":"<figure><img src=\"https://pdc-2022.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/notion/CUE_OrHxZH8QOVAB-TZvgiBiaWUW514ep8XRgQR0jDg.png\"></figure>\n\nThis situated action is kindly inviting the participants to engage in the process of making a stop-motion animation with selected personal objects. The focus will be to re-discover memories, through personal objects and to shed a light on covert cultural identities.\n\n\nThis work is based on current doctoral research that posits that participatory animation as an approach can contribute to evoking and sharing the memories embodied by objects and can support a collective expression and understanding. Previous research has explored how diaspora communities who are dispersed all over the world, such as the Armenian diaspora, maintain a collective memory of their homeland. They carry objects that are representative of their roots and create a sense of belonging alongside objects that depict their everyday life and multicultural identity. Through their tangible aspects, these objects include rich stories that can be made visible through stop-motion photography, made in collaboration with community members who have no experience in film-making.\n\n\n**_Nairy Eivazy, Jan Peeters, Sandy Claes_**\n\n\n**Location:** [**Northumbria University, School of Design (CCE2, room101), Falconar St, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 2SU**](https://goo.gl/maps/NUEheBwQi1mMvKf87)\n\n\n[**Register for this event**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pdc-22-sa-the-objects-we-carry-the-memories-we-share-tickets-377379200347)\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://pdc-2022.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/notion/fFWLDgQrTFa6bssU7EeNzTX3ygbFCLYloZjdP2CRi-o.png\"></figure>\n\n<div class=\"iframeEmbed\"><iframe class=\"iframeEmbed-iframe\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" title=\"Vimeo video player\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/721536519\"></iframe></div>\n\n## Keywords\n\n\nAnimation, Participation, Objects, Diaspora, Memory\n\n\n\n\n\n<a class=\"button is-primary\" download=\"paper.pdf\" href=\"https://pdc-2022.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/notion/C3jV16aaVrHdqeYGmJDY6sy9km2MSN2zEpfntiKXGHI.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download PDF →</a>"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":["be569aab-c69e-4b41-9549-949545edbe40","848f7f39-1325-4c12-8eb9-f2cd27ece8cd","c0e1d398-087f-41f7-8efe-606d38247459"],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":false,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":false,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"00599458-e64d-4c09-bd19-440be552f4bd","type":"378d5ffb-19fa-461c-bc8c-11b21c7d7216","slot":"1661940000000__1661945400000","track":"208826eb-ec6e-4dc0-9c4a-c480968bbe2c","themes":["de139d36-a68d-458a-b6fe-ef571a584a00","cbe43eab-d37f-4276-a154-cfcc2584f83c","9a65fee9-bcbd-4686-86ad-0091c6dbb904"],"title":{"en":"Zineography: Exploring the Participatory Design Process of Collaborative Zine Making (session 1)"},"content":{"en":"<figure><img src=\"https://pdc-2022.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/notion/zLVEUWo8ezFB9IXorLMlTLktL_FQeaA71Ifv9oaKEhQ.png\"></figure>\n\nZines (as in magazines) are self-published publications that are often created, produced, and distributed by their author(s).

Exploring oneself through individual character building, 2. exploring the relationships of those in the community of individuals, 3. navigating scenarios and storytelling together.

Design justice asks us to pay attention to how these infrastructures express the assumptions of the powerful and guides us to design with directly affected communities. In this talk, I will argue that we need to go a step further to address the problem of political agency over digital infrastructures. By political agency, I mean the capacity of agents to create effects through direct and institutional action. I build on longstanding histories of Participatory Design as a political project to expand economic democracy, emphasizing the need to build collective power to achieve these goals today. I will motivate and elaborate this argument with two case studies: a struggle to shape public-private smart cities infrastructure in San Diego, as well as struggles to transform platform work conditions for Amazon Mechanical Turk workers.\n"},"coverImage":null,"links":[],"hostLanguages":["en"],"enableInterpretation":false,"speakers":["ab398222-f4cf-49bd-b4ba-809740816d21"],"hostOrganisation":{"en":"PDC 2022"},"isRecorded":true,"isOfficial":false,"isFeatured":true,"visibility":"public","state":"confirmed","participantCap":null,"hideFromSchedule":false},{"id":"ff18e5dd-b372-4dee-b7f7-d0b524c984d3","type":"e8ad11ab-0eda-42cb-a65d-f5ace7b65f4f","slot":"1662022800000__1662033600000","track":"fb858d34-9492-4596-b5e9-20b9a6e035f2","themes":["cbe43eab-d37f-4276-a154-cfcc2584f83c","319f6e09-8d5b-4900-a96e-e6c65c48f8c4","de139d36-a68d-458a-b6fe-ef571a584a00"],"title":{"en":"Mapping Traditions and Practices of Participation in Participatory work in Ireland"},"content":{"en":"In recent years, practices of public engagement and participation have gained interest in several different areas in Ireland: from Public-Patient Involvement (PPi) in medical research to co-design in cultural heritage, from community consultation for policy making to participatory action research.

While civilizations are judged on their rich architectures and artifacts, structures for negotiation and co-creation may be entirely invisible. Yet our work hinges on these mechanisms. What are the fleeting relations that we value so highly but rarely see captured or conserved? And how might a greater understanding of the feeling of being-part-of-something hold secrets for urgent transformations in society? This talk addresses the crafting of encounter, from invitation, through action to reflection, and explores what years of engaging with such details might tell us, not just about the creation of better artifacts, but of the relations that support life and flourishing at a time of planetary upheaval.

However, we note that – within work with these populations – the vast majority of researchers work with people whose dementia is at an early stage, or whose diagnosis of ASD means that they are verbal and can function well in social situations. Moreover, work within these areas rarely notes that vast diversity of abilities and experiences exist within both conditions. At the same time, strengths-based approaches in both areas (e.g. Greenspan, 2006) have promoted new possibilities for engagement even with low-functioning and advanced cases. Can these approaches help us to rethink what participation could be for people whose social and communicative abilities have waned or deteriorated? What can we learn from strength-based approaches? Can a touch, a hum, or a sigh be considered as a participative act? This panel will invite experts in the area of design for autism and design for dementia to discuss this topic and generate new, critical questions for the claims we make within such design\n\n\n**Location**\nIn-Person: CSG-027, Computer Science Building, University of Limerick, Plassey, Co.

We see it as a great opportunity to expand the role of public libraries even further, engaging citizens in co-design processes, improving existing public services and e-services. In this panel discussion we aim to explore this new role of libraries in participatory future making.\nThis online event will gather Nordic libraries and offer a unique opportunity for inspiration and sharing best practices.

It nourishes us, shapes our social interactions and, as a quintessentially more-than-human concern, connects us to other species and the planet. The ways we eat both shape and are shaped by pressing social and environmental challenges that we must attend to if we are to collectively flourish. The purpose of this workshop is to gather researchers who use participatory and co-design (PD) methods, around a hybrid (virtual and real-world) table, to explore how we approach food in our transformational design research and practice aiming to nourish regenerative – socially and ecologically just – futures. In the workshop, we will share, feast on, and digest our methodological practices and approaches, with the objective to enrich each other’s work, and co-construct a firmer methodological foundation for participatory food design and research.\n\n\nThe workshop is organised within the [**Nordic PDC Place**](https://pdc2022.org/places/nordicen/) **** programme as a hybrid online and in-person event in the [**Oodi Helsinki Central Library**](https://www.oodihelsinki.fi/en/) **** (Finland).
